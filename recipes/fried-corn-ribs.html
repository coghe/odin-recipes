    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>These  air fried corn ribs are reminiscent of Mexican street corn, but each ear is split into quarters and then air fried. I used frozen corn on the cob which I thawed. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 ears ears corn on the cob </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons "Everything but the Elote seasoning" (Trader Joe's®), divided </li>
        <li>nonstick cooking spray </li>
        <li>¼ cup grated cotija cheese </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Mexican crema, crema fresca </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh cilantro, or more to taste </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Steps 1<p>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 7 minutes.</p></li>
        <li>Steps 2<p>Meanwhile stand corn cobs on the end, and with a sharp knife (I used a wüsthof nakiri) cut each ear down the middle. Place corn cob halves flat on a cutting board and cut in half lengthwise (you will get a total of 4 'ribs' per ear of corn).</p></li>
        <li>Steps 3<p>Spray each corn rib with non-stick spray. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of seasoning over the 16 corn ribs.</p></li>
        <li>Steps 4<p>Air fry corn ribs in batches for a total of 12 minutes. Remove from air fryer.</p></li>
        <li>Steps 5<p>Drizzle crema con sal over corn 'ribs' and sprinkle with cotija cheese and remaining seasoning. Garnish with chopped cilantro.</p></li>
    </ol>
